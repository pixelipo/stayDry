## StayDry ##

**StayDry** is a super-simple CLI and GTK3 Python application that helps me decide when to go cycling.
It works by getting your current location and time of day (7-24) and returning the amount of rainfall for that period.

It's basically a playground for Python and GTK3+. Maybe I will create a version for Android and/or add more relevant sources (e.g. air pollution, traffic) in the future.
